# Tic Tac Toe

Tic Tac Toe is a classic two-player game played on a 3x3 grid. The players take turns marking spaces on the grid, aiming to get three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row.

This implementation of Tic Tac Toe offers two modes of play: two-player mode and versus computer mode.

## Two-Player Mode

In two-player mode, two human players can play against each other on the same device. The players alternate turns, with one player being 'X' and the other player being 'O'. The goal is to get three of their respective marks ('X' or 'O') in a row.

## Versus Computer Mode

In versus computer mode, the player can play against the computer AI. The player controls 'X', and the computer controls 'O'. The player takes the first turn, followed by the computer. The player aims to get three 'X' marks in a row, while the computer aims to get three 'O' marks in a row.

The computer AI makes its moves randomly, selecting an available position on the grid.

## How to Play

1. Run the script in a Python environment.
2. Select the desired mode of play:
   - Two-Player: Enter `1` to play against another human player.
   - Versus Computer: Enter `2` to play against the computer AI.
3. Follow the on-screen prompts to enter the positions to place your mark ('X' or 'O') on the grid. Positions are represented by numbers from 0 to 8, corresponding to the cells on the grid.
4. The game will display the updated grid after each move and inform you of the game outcome (win, draw, or continue).
5. Enjoy playing Tic Tac Toe!
